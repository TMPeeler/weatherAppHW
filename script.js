//first I will need to implement and link all of my prerequisite files  -----------
//(javascript, jQuery, moment, OpenWeatherAPI, CSS, Bootstrap) ------
//Then I will build my basic HTML elements so that they can be styled to 
//make room for the appended elements
//Then I will make a form (prevent default) that has a search bar and button
//When the button is pressed, if the text field has content that matches data from openWeatherAPi, it will show that city and its weather forecast as 
//it will save the name of that city and the weather conditions in the local storage as a variable
//after the button is pressed it will make a button with the name of the city that will make a request for the forecast upon click of that button
